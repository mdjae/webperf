# Magento Performance With MySQL Query Cache
In a product database containing over 80,000 items, 
our test results show a non-cached query returning in just over 11 seconds.
This same query performed a second time results in using the cached query 
and produces the same result set in just over 1 second.


mysql> SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'have_query_cache';
+------------------+----------+
| Variable_name    | Value    |
+------------------+----------+
| have_query_cache | YES      |
+------------------+----------+



If you are using a standard MySQL binary this value is always YES, 
even if query caching is disabled so it's not time for great joy, yet.

mysql> SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'query_cache_size';
+------------------+----------+
| Variable_name    | Value    |
+------------------+----------+
| query_cache_size | 67108864 | 
+------------------+----------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

If you have root access, making a change to this value is trivial. 
Simply add the following line to your my.conf file in the [mysqld] 
section and restart your MySQL server:

query_cache_size=32M
